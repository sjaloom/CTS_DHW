  *** Warning: You are using a flow or pressure controlled mover with the
             default pressure curve.
             This leads to approximate calculations of the electrical power
             consumption. Add the correct pressure curve in the record per
             to obtain an accurate computation.
             Setting nominalValuesDefineDefaultPressureCurve=true will suppress this warning.
  Failed condition: fan.nominalValuesDefineDefaultPressureCurve

  In Model_House.window_North: You may have intended to model a frame since the parameter 'frac' is larger than zero. However, no frame type is configured such that no frame will be modelled. This may be a mistake. Set frac=0 to avoid this warning if this is intentional.
